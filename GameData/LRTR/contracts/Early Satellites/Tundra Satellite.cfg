	description = A Tundra orbit is a highly elliptical geosynchronous orbit (note: not geostationary orbit) with a high inclination (usually near 63.4) and an orbital period of one sidereal day. A satellite placed in this orbit spends most of its time over a chosen area of the Earth, a phenomenon known as apogee dwell. The ground track of a satellite in a tundra orbit is a closed figure eight. An extreme version of this orbit puts the Perigee around 1000 km and the Apogee around 70,000 km. The orbit in this contract is actually using data from the Sirius Satellites that are the only known satellites using a Tundra orbit.&br;&br;Place a satellite into a Tundra Orbit.&br;&br;There will be an orbit showing in the map view and tracking station. You do not have to place the satellite into this orbit, but it is instead meant to show you where your Perigee and Apogee should approximately be located, but more importantly, it shows the proper shape of the orbit.

	synopsis = Launch a satellite into a Tundra Orbit

	completedMessage = Success! The Tundra orbit is highly eccentric and let's the satellite spend most of its time over the high latitudes.
